        It uses backtracking by enumerating the search space of mapping channel
        index values to edges to the coordinate path. An example is that the edge
        from node 1 to node 2 can get assgined channel 0 at index 0. An example of
        a forest of trees generated by this backtracking algorithm:
        
        say we have channels [0,1,2,3] and we have 3 nodes on our route (2 edges).
        We will generate a tree of height 2 (we need to assign two channels to the
        edges) and it would look like this:
        
        0 -> (2, 3) 1 -> (3), 2 -> (0), 3 -> (0, 1) as a forest of 4 trees.
        We would then have enumerated all these channel_id assignments:
        [0,2   0,3   1,3   3,2   2,0   3,0   3,1]
        Notice how we didn't assign channels subject to interference.
        
        Because we must choose from these paths, we store each path in a priority
        queue and choose the channel allocation with the minimum weight.
        
        Weight here is the lowest sum of exponentially distributed channel 
        interarrival rates. Low interarrival weights signify that the channel
        has the least likely chance of being occupied and therefore is the best choice
        
        We prune the search space by eliminating all the channels that have interference.
        Interference here is defined as  channels that are used within the 
        transmission radius of another node and the two adjacent channels to that
        used channel. 
        
        We then store each path candidate in a priority queue and return the top
        value, which is the cheapest path.
