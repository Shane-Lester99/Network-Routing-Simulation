# Software Designed Networking Controller for Ad Hoc Networks: Simulation

This application provides a simulation of ad hoc networking protocols defined at the software level with a frontend data dashboard and a backend that runs millions of tests and generates data points on findings. It accompanies an academic paper I wrote. 

To run this application open a google chrome browser with the `open_browser_for_demo.sh` the script, run the `run_backend.sh` script, and run the command  `npm start`.

This academic paper that accompanies this application is [here](https://github.com/Shane-Lester99/Software-Defined-Networking-Controller-for-Ad-Hoc-Networks-Simulation/blob/master/networking_advance_paper.pdf).
